# CS120B-Elevator
This custom lab project for CS120B Winter 2019 demonstrates the functionality of an elevator lift, using the components listed below.

## Build-Upons
1. BCD to 7 segment display
2. DC Motor
4. USART (2 microcontrollers)

## Other Components
1. Number pad
2. Button

## How it Works
Beginning at the 1st floor, the user is able to select the desired floor for the elevator to move to (either 1 or 2) via the number pad; the selected number appears on the BCD to 7 segment display. Then, once the user presses the button, the DC motor will start to spin either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the current floor.
